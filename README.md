TI-BASIC Programs
=================

The .tib source files provided here are compiled using [TI-Basic Compiler](http://tibasic.sourceforge.net/), which converts an ASCII .tib file into a binary .8xp file that can be sent to a calculator. You can transfer .8xp programs to Windows or Mac using Texas Instruments' official [TI-Connect](http://education.ti.com/en/us/products/computer_software/connectivity-software/ti-connect-software/features/features-summary) software; for Linux I suggest [TiLP](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_tilp/).
